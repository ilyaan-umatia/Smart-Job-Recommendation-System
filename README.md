# Smart-Job-Recommendation-System
AI Lab Project

A Streamlit-based application that recommends jobs using a hybrid approach: an offline-trained TF-IDF + KNN model on Linkedin job dataset, and real-time job listings fetched from the JSearch API.
This project helps users discover the most relevant job opportunities based on their interests and skills. It provides personalized job recommendations tailored to individual preferences. The system ensures users can explore both existing and newly listed job openings with ease.
